## What is crowdfunding

Small/medium projects have a need to get funds to implement or improve it. It doesn't matter what you do, it can be an open source project, building a rocket to the moon or  a charitable fund. You can get investments from private investors if your project looks interesting or solving user problems.

## Why crypto coins

Crypto is gaining popularity in the world, a lot of enthusiasts use it everyday. Efficiency and low cost are reasons why using crypto becomes populars. In an old-fashioned way you store money in a bank, so you can't get full control of it. Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) adds transparency.

## What is Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)

All collected coins are stored in smart-contracts that can be managed by investors. Each investor has a number of votes (tokens), that depend on the amount of investments, in order to approve/reject any proposal. Transferring crypto coins to a project founder(-s) can be approved only by investors via DAO. Any investor has an ability to create a new proposal and DAO can approve or reject it.


## How to avoid scam projects

The blockchain is a transparent system and each user can track transfering crypto coins inside. Next level is DAO, that makes a decision to approve/reject transfer. All added projects are performed moderation before it will be opened in public.
